# ContactApp
Creating a Application using Reactjs and redux with reducers etc
I had use React function components for creating a reusable piece of code 
And also used React Hooks 
used useState to update state for the following Email ,Name, Number 
used destructuing const [name ,setName] =useState("") to define the state to update the state 
done validations used conditionals for checking the data entered and throwing a warning with toastify
Created a navigation bar 
creating a form with input name placeholder for taking the data for Name, Email , Phone Number 
Added a Submit button to check and throw alert /warning if it user already exists or invalid details /invalid fields 

Such as "Please fill in all fields" ,"This phone number already exists!!"
"This email already exists!!"

Done importing the route and adding things such as links ,path etc

added contact reducer in redux\reducer
